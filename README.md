# CIS343-Zork
text based game




NOTES:

So for the uses left, I couldn't figure out how to get it running, but I found where our problem is. So right now, the Hershey kiss is working how it should properly work. THe only problem is it also attacks humans. It attacks every monster in the room serperately. SO if there are 6 monsters(also people) it will use the item six times. We are going to have to find a way to maybe add a dialog to check which monster they would like to attack with which item. I ended up breaking the code so I didn't push what I had, but 


something like if wpnoption == 0

(Do what we originally did)

else
whichMon = input("Which monster would you like to attack with", (weapon they picked), "?")

  attack monster depending on which monster they picked, etc.
